## 📁 **Step 3: Prepare Your Data**

### **🤔 What Kind of Data Do We Need?**
We need **3D point cloud files** - these are files with lots of 3D points representing objects.

### **📄 Supported File Types:**
- ✅ **.las** files (most common)
- ✅ **.laz** files (compressed LAS)
- ✅ **.ply** files
- ✅ **.pcd** files
- ✅ **.xyz** files

### **📁 Step 3A: Create Folders**
```bash
# 📂 Make folders for your data
mkdir -p data/train
mkdir -p data/val  
mkdir -p data/test

# What these folders are for:
# 🎓 train/ = Data to teach the AI (most of your data goes here)
# 🧪 val/ = Data to check if AI is learning correctly
# 🏆 test/ = Data to test final performance (AI never sees this during training)
```

### **📋 Step 3B: Organize Your Data**

#### **If You Have Real LiDAR Data:**
```bash
# Copy your files to the right folders
# 🎓 Put 70% of your files in train/
cp your_lidar_files/*.las data/train/

# 🧪 Put 20% of your files in val/
cp some_other_files/*.las data/val/

# 🏆 Put 10% of your files in test/
cp final_test_files/*.las data/test/
```

#### **If You Don't Have Data (That's OK!):**
The system comes with **smart fake data** that lets you test everything!

```bash
# Don't worry! The AI system will create perfect test data for you
# Just run the training - it will work automatically!

# The fake data includes:
# 🏠 Buildings and structures
# 🌳 Trees and vegetation  
# 🚗 Vehicles
# 🛣️ Roads and sidewalks
# 🌊 Water bodies
# And 250+ other categories!
```

### **📊 Step 3C: Check Your Data**
```bash
# 🔍 Let's see what we have
echo "Train files: $(ls data/train/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Validation files: $(ls data/val/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"  
echo "Test files: $(ls data/test/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"

# Good numbers:
# Train: 50-1000+ files ✅
# Val: 10-200+ files ✅  
# Test: 5-100+ files ✅
```

## 🐛 **Help! Something Went Wrong**

### **😰 Common Problems and Solutions**

#### **Problem 1: "conda: command not found"**
```bash
# 💡 Solution: Install conda first
# Windows: Download from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
# Mac: brew install miniconda  
# Linux: See Step 2A above

# Then restart your terminal/command prompt
```

#### **Problem 2: "CUDA out of memory"**
```bash
# 💡 Solution: Use smaller batch size
python train_conda_optimized.py \
    --data-dir ./data \
    --batch-size 8      # Instead of 16
    --enable-automl

# Or even smaller:
    --batch-size 4      # For very limited GPU memory
```

#### **Problem 3: "No module named 'torch'"**
```bash
# 💡 Solution: Make sure environment is activated
conda activate ai-enhanced-lidar

# If still doesn't work, reinstall PyTorch:
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

#### **Problem 4: Training is Very Slow**
```bash
# 💡 Solutions:

# Check if GPU is being used:
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"

# If FALSE, reinstall PyTorch with CUDA:
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Use smaller data for testing:
python train_conda_optimized.py --data-dir ./data --epochs 5 --batch-size 4
```

#### **Problem 5: "Permission Denied" Errors**
```bash
# 💡 Solutions:

# On Windows: Run as Administrator
# Right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as Administrator"

# On Mac/Linux: Check permissions
chmod +x train_conda_optimized.py

# Or run with python explicitly:
python train_conda_optimized.py --data-dir ./data --enable-automl
```

#### **Problem 6: AutoML Fails**
```bash
# 💡 Solution: Run without AutoML first
python train_conda_optimized.py \
    --data-dir ./data \
    --epochs 20

# If this works, then try AutoML with fewer trials:
python train_conda_optimized.py \
    --data-dir ./data \
    --enable-automl \
    --epochs 20
```
